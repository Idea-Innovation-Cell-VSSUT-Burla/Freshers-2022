# Git-And-GitHub
**Welcome!!** Freshers- 2022.

## Importance of Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

### What is Version Control System (VCS)?

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.

### Advantages of VCS

a) Enhances the project development speed by providing efficient collaboration.

b) Leverages the productivity, expedite product delivery, and skills of the employees through better communication and assistance.

c) Reduce possibilities of errors and conflicts meanwhile project development through traceability to every small change.

d) Employees or contributor of the project can contribute from anywhere irrespective of the different geographical locations through this VCS.

e) For each different contributor of the project a different working copy is maintained and not merged to the main file unless the working copy is validated. A most popular example is Git, Helix core, Microsoft TFS.

f) Helps in recovery in case of any disaster or contingent situation.

g) Informs us about Who, What, When, Why changes have been made.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an intricate platform that fosters collaboration and communication between developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions, but it doesn’t stop there.

Once new additions to a program are complete, for example, they can easily be incorporated into existing programs. GitHub also makes it extremely simple to work together on strings of code to really dial in and perfect even the smallest parts of a program. With GitHub, you can collaborate and work on projects with others anywhere in the world.
